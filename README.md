Project Title: E-Commerce Website (For Learning Purposes)

Developed by: Furkan Koçer

This project was developed as part of my learning process. It’s a fully functional e-commerce website where users can browse products, add items to their cart, make purchases, and more.

Key Features:

Product Browsing & Cart System: Users can view products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

Admin Panel: Admins can add, edit, and manage products on the website.

Brand News Section: A section dedicated to showcasing brand news and updates.

Purchase Functionality: Checkout and order management.

Purchase Notification: Users receive a notification after purchasing a product, including details such as product name, price, quantity bought, etc.

Technologies Used:

Front-End: React.js, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

Back-End: ASP.NET Core for building APIs

Database: MongoDB

This project was my second e-commerce website after graduation. I didn’t use any specific architectural patterns at the time, as I was still learning. Now, with my current knowledge, I could implement the project in a more structured and efficient way.

Further Development:

If you want to see what I am capable of in terms of more structured API development, you can check out my WebApiFilmProject, which follows a layered architecture design pattern for a more scalable and maintainable API structure.
